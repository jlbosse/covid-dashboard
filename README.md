# Jan Lukas' Covid-19 Dashboard

This is an iPython-Notebook to explore the Covid-19 data provided by the
[Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
In it we import the data and cleans it a bit (not all countries are treated
equal in it, sadly...) and then start with some analysis. Mostly, it should
serve as a starting point for your own analysis without having to do the
preparational steps yourself and have some of the "default" plots ready made
for you.

You can view it in your browser [here](https://github.com/jlbosse/covid-dashboard/blob/master/Covid19Dashboard.ipynb)
or (better!) download it into your computer and play with it via 
```console
foo@foobar:~$ git clone https://github.com/jlbosse/covid-dashboard.git
```
